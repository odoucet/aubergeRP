# 🏰 AubergeRP

**The cozy, distraction-free roleplay engine.** *Stop configuring, start roleplaying.*

AubergeRP is a lightweight, self-hostable alternative to SillyTavern. It’s designed for those who want a beautiful, "plug-and-play" experience with local or remote LLMs, featuring native AI image generation without the headache of complex extensions.

The Docker setup ships with a bundled [LocalAI](https://localai.io/) instance — text and image models are **downloaded automatically** on first run, so you get a fully working text + image stack with a single command and no manual model management.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Zero-Friction Setup:** Get running in minutes with Docker.
* **Universal Connectivity:** Support for any OpenAI-compatible API (Ollama, OpenRouter, **but also local setup!** vLLM, ollama, etc.).
* **SillyTavern Compatible:** Seamlessly import and export your favorite `.png` or `.json` character cards.
* **Smart Image Generation:** The AI triggers image generation automatically based on the story context (via ComfyUI or SD-WebUI).
* **Lightweight Stack:** No complex build steps. Just Python (FastAPI) and Vanilla JS.
* **Admin Dashboard:** Easily manage your connectors, characters, and check your usage stats.


## 🛠 Quick Start

1. **Clone & Config**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/odoucet/aubergeRP.git
   cd aubergeRP
   cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
   ```

2. **Launch with Docker**
   ```bash
   make docker
   ```
   This starts AubergeRP standalone, you will need to plug text/image LLM.
   Use this if you have no GPU or just want to test the app with a remote LLM.

   If you do have a GPU : 
   ```bash
   make docker gpu=rtx3090
   ```
   This starts AubergeRP with a LocalAI instance, which will automatically download and serve the configured text and image models.

   If your model is not listed, use one closer to it in terms of VRAM usage, and edit the `docker/profiles/*.yml` files to set the correct model name for LocalAI.


3. **Enjoy!**
   Open **http://localhost:8123**. The admin password is displayed in your terminal logs.
   * Go to **Admin** -> The LocalAI text connector is pre-configured. Some characters are already provisioned to try out, but you can also import a character and start your story.
   * Image generation works out of the box once the model download completes.

## About me
I'm Olivier. I have nearly 30 years XP in dev/ops and I'm thrilled of the new AI era that allows me to develop this kind of project without putting too much time into it.
I have a very busy work (I'm CEO), a beautiful family I like to spend time with, and many hobbies.
This project is the 99th priority in my life. I work on it on my (small) free time, and I try to keep it as simple and maintainable as possible for the long term, so I can keep improving it for years to come without it becoming a burden.
If you want to contribute, please maintain this philosophy in mind and try to keep things simple and well documented. 

**AubergeRP** is a labor of love. If you like the project, consider giving it a ⭐ on GitHub!
