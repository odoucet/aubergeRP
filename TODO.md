# TODO

Items not yet implemented. PRs welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

When using the project and navigating, I sometimes add items here that I think are missing or could be improved. This is not an exhaustive list of all the work that needs to be done, but it gives an idea of the current state of the project and the next steps.

## High priority

(nothing yet)

## Medium priority

- [ ] **Hallucination mitigation** — detect clearly off-topic or repetitive responses; retry with a corrective system message. Config: `chat.hallucination_retry`.

- [ ] **Configurable NSFW filter** — pre/post-processing layer. Config: `chat.nsfw_filter` (`off` | `warn` | `block`). Actually the implementation is very incomplete, with just a declaration on connectors but no actual filtering logic. There is a prompt for this, make sure it is used correctly. 
On frontend, all images generated with an NSFW connector must be blurried by default and visible only when the user clicks on them.

- [ ] Improve media listing on admin : able to view dozens of file easily (table formating, pagination, ...). A small preview must be available ; view easily image full-size on click. In the future, there will be video and audio files, so prepare the UI for this.

## Low priority / Future

- [ ] **Full user authentication** — password or IP-allowlist protecting the chat UI (the admin panel already has its own password). Config: `app.auth_mode` (`none` | `password` | `ip_allowlist`).
- [ ] **Multi-character conversations** — more than one character per conversation.
- [ ] **Multi-model support** — separate connectors for chat, summarization, and classification.
- [ ] **Proactive image triggering** — LLM decides on its own when to emit an image (not only on explicit user request). Maybe work on the system prompt to let the LLM know it can do this ?
- [ ] **Quota management** — per-conversation token limit, when connecting external APIs with quotas (like OpenAI). 
- [ ] **Video generation connector** (`[VID: …]` marker, `VideoConnector` interface) — currently hidden from the UI until implemented. Design the connector interface, define the SSE event flow, and add UI controls for video playback.
- [ ] **Audio/TTS connector** — play synthesized speech after each assistant message. Currently hidden from the UI. Design the connector interface and add playback controls to the chat UI.
- [ ] Handle storing version (used in GUI and API).
- [ ] Maintain a list of character cards websites. Actually : 
      * https://jannyai.com/characters
- [ ] One-click translation of a character card in another language, using the LLM. This is a common user request and would be a nice feature to have. It could be implemented as a button on the admin panel, next to each character, that triggers the translation process.

## Documentation / housekeeping

- [ ] Write usage examples: OpenRouter API key setup, local Ollama, ComfyUI, importing SillyTavern characters.
- [ ] Document Docker GPU profiles => auto generate doc based on `docker/profiles/*.yaml` files with LLM used and size (note: where to grab this info ?).
